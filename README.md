Im open for sugestions for features and help if anyone wants :)

Installation tutorial will be released when the code is done.

COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH CAS2 AND CAS3 SYSTEMS that use the keyslot system with the start/stop button ( ANYTHING OLDER AND NEWER WONT WORK ) 

Once the project is done i will add support for automatic cars and cars that use normal turn key system ( but i need help from people that have that system )

Features:
Remote start from original key
Remote start from app
See remaining range in app
Control windows,doors,alarm,blower from app
Stall detection ( can restart the engine automatically when clutch is pressed ) ( need original cluster to be installed for that )
Theft protection if started from app and phone is not close to the car and someone jumps in to drive it it will turn off the engine and sound the alarm )
parking+shifter+battery interlock ( if one of those is not correct the remote start is not allowed )
Fully designed in case of failure.

The app can display various errors and for some even say them out loud 
Shifer not in neural
Parking brake not on
Battery low
Phone bluetooth off
etc
there will be several versions available depending on customer demand at different prices
